<p>As a very inquisitive individual who strives for self-development, I am currently working towards to the completion of the Law (LLB) for graduates program at the University of Birmingham. I currently hold a degree in Criminology and Sociology from the University of Windsor, Canada. </p>
      <p>I have been fortunate to work within immigration facilities, day centers for individuals with intellectual disabilities and also mentored youths.Â  I love to network, travel, and engage in creative activities. I decided to join Nigeria Dialogue because I believe in the development of individuals. </p>
      <p>I love to make an impact in the community, and I see Nigeria dialogue as a great starting point.</p>
