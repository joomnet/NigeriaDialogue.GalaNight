      <p>I am an IT consultant. I am happily married to a lovely wife and we have a son. By day, I consult with a car manufacturing company in the UK but in the evening I am focused on supporting Nigeria Dialogue and also working to complete my MBA. </p>
<p>I have a dream. My dream is to be a part of the team to effect change in the Nigeria and most importantly to see lives transformed positively. </p>
<p>When I am not working, schooling or supporting Nigeria Dialogue, I spend time with my family, I play football, I watch football, I go horse riding and also have heated debates about any passionate topic like change in Nigeria. </p>
<p>I am a part of Nigeria Dialogue because I believe in the movement to effect change in Nigeria. The train of change is heading to Nigeria and getting on that train affords me the chance to be a part of it. </p>
