      <p>I am Broadcast Journalist and a proud Nigerian concerned with the issues that affect the everyday life of Nigerians in our great nation. </p>
      <p>Working with Nigeria Dialogue for me brings two of my biggest passions together i.e. media and ‘’Nigeria’’. </p>
      <p>After having numerous conversations with friends and family about how the youth in Nigeria have been excluded from the ‘dialogue’ to take the nation forward, I felt it was the right thing to do being a part of a progressive collective like Nigeria Dialogue.</p>
      <p>My aim is solely to champion the huge impact that the youth can make on changing the face and fortunes of our beloved country Nigeria.</p>
